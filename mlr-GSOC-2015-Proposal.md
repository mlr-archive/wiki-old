a) On this page we will outline our GSOC 2015 project proposal

## Projects

* [Improving mlr's hyperparameter and tuning system for efficient model selection](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr/wiki/GSOC-2015:-Improving-mlr's-hyperparameter-and-tuning-system-for-efficient-model-selection)
* [Improving mlr's visualisations](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr/wiki/GSOC-2015:-Improving-mlr's-visualisations)
* [Implement several ensemble SVMs in mlr](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr/wiki/GSOC-2015:-Implement-several-ensemble-SVMs-in-mlr)

## Global info for all projects

### Where do we communicate:

* Post in this thread and "watch" it: https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr/issues/252

### What skills do I need:

* Good R programmer
* Git and Github
* Interest in and at least a little bit background knowledge of machine learning / predictive modelling
* Package development with devtools, testthat, roxygen2
* Being able to cooperate with a larger number of people on a larger software project. This requires skills in software engineering, communication and some diligence.

### What do I need to send to the mentors? 

* Background Info about yourself. Who are you, which university, which subject? Why do you have the skills? A link to your active Github account is also perfect. 
* Which project(s) are you willing to work on?
* Make 1-2 merge requests that demonstrate your skills.

### What is a demo merge request
* We don't really care so much what you specifically work on, but we want to see that that you can work in such a larger project with skill and dilligence.
* **Follow the coding guidelines in the Wiki**!
* Adding a new learner to mlr is a good and simple start. 
* If you feel more adventurous you can browse through the active issues and help with a (simple) one.
Not every one might be perfectly outlined. ASK and COMMUNICATE with us in this case, before you start!
* Ask us if you need to.
