a) On this page we will outline our GSOC 2015 project proposal
IF THIS LINE IS HERE THE PROPOSAL IS NOT DONE YET!

b) We are willing to work with students and mentor other projects which deal with
"mlr - Machine Learning in R" if students have a different preference for another topic in machine learning / the software.
**Students then need to approach us soon enough so we can work on such a proposal together.**
