Here is some background information about the mentors you will work with.



###  Aydin Demircioglu

After my PhD in differential geometry (Potsdam, Germany), I worked for nearly six years as a software
and research engineer in image processing at several companies. Apart from
programming, I also served several times as a project manager. I mainly employed
agile techniques and Scrum in special. 
Since 2013 I am a postdoc for machine learning at the chair "Theory of Machine
Learning" at the Institute for Neural Informatics (INI) in Bochum, Germany.
Our group has a distinct focus on Support Vector Machines. In our ongoing
project we did a broad empirical evaluation of SVMs on large scale data.
As an direct extension of this, I currently work on ensemble SVMs. The proposed GSOC 
project will be a realization of this work in R.
