Here is some background information about the mentors you will work with.

### Bernd Bischl

### Aydin Demircioglu

After my PhD in differential geometry (Potsdam, Germany), I worked for nearly six years as a software
and research engineer in image processing at several companies. Apart from
programming, I also served several times as a project manager. I mainly employed
agile techniques and Scrum in special. 
Since 2013 I am a postdoc for machine learning at the chair "Theory of Machine
Learning" at the Institute for Neural Informatics (INI) in Bochum, Germany.
Our group has a distinct focus on Support Vector Machines. In our ongoing
project we did a broad empirical evaluation of SVMs on large scale data.
As an direct extension of this, I currently work on ensemble SVMs. The proposed GSOC 
project will be a realization of this work in R.

### Lars Kotthoff

### Michel Lang

I've just finished my PhD thesis in statistics at the University of Dortmund where I will fulfill a postdoc position for the next months.
I'm programming R for more than 10 years now and I've given several courses and lectures on efficient and parallel computing with R. 
I'm author and/or maintainer of many R packages (e.g., [checkmate](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate), [fmrmr](https://github.com/mllg/fmrmr), [fail](https://github.com/mllg/fail), [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs), [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchExperiments), [mlr](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr)).
My research topics include survival analysis, high dimensional data, parallel computing, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. Thus, the proposed GSCOC project I would co-mentor with Bernd is closely connected to my personal research interests. 
I've been a GSOC student back in 2013 where I implemented support for BatchJobs in the [BiocParallel](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocParallel) package.
