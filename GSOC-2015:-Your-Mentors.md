Here is some background information about the mentors you will work with.

### Bernd Bischl
I am from April on a Professor of computational statistics at the LMU Munich. I have a very broad background in machine learning and long-term experience in software engineering. I have written quite a few R packages, as visible from my Github account, and am the maintainer of mlr and e.g. the BatchJobs package. I am very interested in hyper-parameter tuning and model selection in my current research, which is the reason why I am mentoring the "hyperparameter / tuning" project.

### Aydin Demircioglu

After my PhD in differential geometry (Potsdam, Germany), I worked for nearly six years as a software
and research engineer in image processing at several companies. Apart from
programming, I also served several times as a project manager. I mainly employed
agile techniques and Scrum in special. 
Since 2013 I am a postdoc for machine learning at the chair "Theory of Machine
Learning" at the Institute for Neural Informatics (INI) in Bochum, Germany.
Our group has a distinct focus on Support Vector Machines. In our ongoing
project we did a broad empirical evaluation of SVMs on large scale data.
As an direct extension of this, I currently work on ensemble SVMs. The proposed GSOC 
project will be a realization of this work in R.

### Lars Kotthoff

I hold a PhD from the University of St Andrews since 2012 and have held 2 postdoctoral appointments since then. My research focuses on combinatorial search in artificial intelligence and how it can be combined with machine learning to, on one hand, make machine learning more scalable and flexible, and on the other combinatorial search more adaptive and intelligent. In my spare time, I am playing with various visualisation libraries especially in Javascript, which is where the idea for the project I'm mentoring came from. I have extensive experience mentoring students, having supervised project and thesis students at undergraduate and postgraduate level. In addition, I have developed and taught several courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

### Michel Lang

I've just finished my PhD thesis in statistics at the University of Dortmund where I will fulfill a postdoc position for the next months.
I'm programming R for more than 10 years now and I've given several courses and lectures on efficient and parallel computing with R. 
I'm author and/or maintainer of many R packages (e.g., [checkmate](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate), [fmrmr](https://github.com/mllg/fmrmr), [fail](https://github.com/mllg/fail), [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs), [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchExperiments), [mlr](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr)).
My research topics include survival analysis, high dimensional data, parallel computing, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. Thus, the proposed GSOC project I would co-mentor with Bernd is closely connected to my personal research interests. 
I've been a GSOC student back in 2013 where I implemented support for BatchJobs in the [BiocParallel](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocParallel) package.

### Julia Schiffner
I hold a master's degree in statistics. My research interests are in machine learning,
particularly supervised classification and benchmarking, and my current focus is on
high-dimensional data (especially SNP data).
I have written and contributed to several R-packages which can be found on
[github](https://github.com/schiffner) and [R-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/locclass/).
I have extensive experience and interest in teaching, having both supervised theses students and
taught statistics and R programming courses.
