I am professor of computational statistics at the LMU Munich. I created mlr a long time ago at the beginning of my PhD. I have worked on many different parts of mlr, mainly the internal OO system, the wrappers and tuning - although quite a few people helped to refactor the package a lot and to turn it into something much better. I have probably contributed next to nothing to the great tutorial.

I am a postdoc at the TU Dortmund and one of the main developers of mlr. I've worked on many internal parts of mlr and started to implement support for survival analysis.

I am assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Wyoming. My main contributions to mlr include support for clustering. Apart from that I'm usually fighting Travis in one way or another.

# NEWS

mlr 2.14

## learners -- new
* `{classif,regr}.liquidSVM`

mlr 2.13

## general
* Stratification can happen on integer columns now. Only doubles are not allowed.
* Get the inner indices of a (nested) resampling setting that was called using `resample(extract = getTuneResult)`.

## functions - new
* `getResamplingIndices()` to get nested resampling indices for tuning and feature selection.

## learners -- general
* `regr.ranger` now supports instance weights.

## measures -- general
* BAC now supports multiclass.
