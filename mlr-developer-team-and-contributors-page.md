I am professor of computational statistics at the LMU Munich. I created mlr a long time ago at the beginning of my PhD. I have worked on many different parts of mlr, mainly the internal OO system, the wrappers and tuning - although quite a few people helped to refactor the package a lot and to turn it into something much better. I have probably contributed next to nothing to the great tutorial.

I am a postdoc at the TU Dortmund and one of the main developers of mlr. I've worked on many internal parts of mlr and started to implement support for survival analysis.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia. My main contributions to mlr include support for clustering algorithms. Apart from that I'm usually fighting Travis in one way or another.

PhD Student in Statistics at TU Dortmund. Working on mlr since 2012. Always wanting to add some functionality, ending up revising a lot of stuff. Also involved in the development in related packages as [ParamHelpers](https://github.com/berndbischl/ParamHelpers) and mainly [mlrMBO](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlrMBO) recently.

I am a PhD student at the LMU Munich and member of the computational statistics working group. I added support for several stacking algorithms.

I am a Master's student at the LMU Munich and member of the computational statistics working group. I'm helping to clean up the issue tracker in general and will be implementing time series tasks in the course of my Master's Thesis.

Master's Student at LMU Munich, implemented some visualizations on BenchmarkResults and hopefully some more in the future.

PhD Student at IBE, LMU Munich. Implemented (parts of) the multilabel classification in mlr. Currently doing benchmarks on OpenML datasets with mlr, comparing different learners and getting informations and good defaults for hyperparameters of implemented learners.
