This page list the mlr developers over time, and what other individual have contributed to the project.
Please add yourself here when you feel you have done something worthwhile.

## Bernd Bischl
I am professor of computational statistics at the LMU Munich. I created mlr a long time ago at the beginning of my PhD. I have worked on many different parts of mlr, mainly the internal OO system, the wrappers and tuning - although quite a few people helped to refactor the package a lot and to turn it into something much better. I have probably contributed next to nothing to the great tutorial.  

## Lars Kotthoff
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia. My main contributions to mlr include support for clustering algorithms. Apart from that I'm usually fighting Travis in one way or another.

## Giuseppe Casalicchio
I am a PhD student at the LMU Munich and member of the computational statistics working group. I added support for several stacking algorithms.

## Zachary Jones
I am a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University and a former Google Summer of Code student. I work mainly on visualization.
