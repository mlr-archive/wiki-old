* Use a proper editor for programming. Like vim, emacs, sublime, RStudio. 

* Read and follow the style guide here. Yes, really. Bernd hates cleaning up such stuff behind others.

* Every (major) piece of code you add or change must be unit tested.

* If you find a bug, always do this: Reproduce via test, THEN repair. Then make sure test runs. Reread the code piece a gain you touched. Can the structure be improved? If this can be done quickly, do it now.
For more complex stuff: Open up clearly understandable issue. Best with a minimal and reproducing example.
