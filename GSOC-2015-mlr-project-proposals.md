a) On this page we will outline our GSOC 2015 project proposals

b) We are willing to work with students and mentor other projects which deal with
"mlr - Machine Learning in R" if students have a different preference for another topic in machine learning / the software.
**Students then need to approach us soon enough so we can work on such a proposal together.**
